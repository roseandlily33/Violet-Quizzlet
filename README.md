# Coding Quiz
Week 4 project was to build a coding quiz challenge, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web API's. It should have a multiple questions, a home page, high score page, all done page, and the question page, where there will be new questions.

## Difficulties:
This was the most difficult project so far because I was building it from the ground up with no previous code to go off of. I watched a couple of videos on youtube to really grasp the concepts and what to put into the project and what goes where.

I also got help from BCS, and tutoring.


## Usage:
To use click the start button, where you will be taken through multiple different questions, if you select a questions that isn't right you will have 10 seconds deducted from your total score. At the end of the quiz you can enter your initials which you can add to the highscore board you can also restart the game which will take you back to the start page, and you can also clear the highscore leadboard.

## What I learned:
I learned a lot about the Web API's, about selecting them how to use them and when to use them. I've learned for simplier coding in CSS to put var(--) for font sizing in the :root so it makes it more consitent if I want to change something throught the code, and plan to implement anything that is changable like that into future projects. I also learned since this is the biggest project that I've built how important naming is and how easy it is for code to get messy really fast. 

## What makes it stand out:
I think that it stands out because I had a vision of what I wanted in my head taking the colour purple that was in the original project I thought was so fitting to this type of quiz, and adding some fun features like the glow to the box, rounded edges makes it more payful, while keeping it all in a monochromatic purple scheme that was very fun.
