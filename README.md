# Coding Quiz
Week 4 project was to build a coding quiz challenge, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web API's. It should have a multiple questions, a home page, high score page, all done page, and the question page, where there will be new questions.

## Difficulties:
This was the most difficult project so far because I was building it from the ground up with no previous code to go off of. I watched a couple of videos on youtube to really grasp the concepts and what to put into the project and what goes where.

## Usage:
To use click the start button, where you will be taken through multiple different questions, if you select a questions that isn't right you will have 10 seconds deducted from your total score. At the end of the quiz you can enter your initials which you can add to the highscore board. 

## What I learned:
I learned a lot about the Web API's, about selecting them how to use them and when to use them. I've learned for simplier coding in CSS to put var(--) for font sizing in the :root so it makes it more consitent if I want to change something throught the code, and plan to implement anything that is changable like that into future projects.

## What makes it stand out:
I think that it stands out because I wanted it to look a certain way instead of just a list of questions, I wanted them to be side by side and when the colour is selected for the question that it changes to green or red.
